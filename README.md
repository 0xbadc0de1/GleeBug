# GleeBug
GleeBug is a **Debugging Framework for Windows** aimed at making debugging enjoyable. It should be complete, highly customizable and easy to use. Feel free to clone and send a pull request or report a bug!

Notice that the project is currently very volatile so for this reason pull requests with new features might be rejected if I feel like they don't fit the current codebase.
